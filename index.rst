Notes on Statistical Mechanics and Thermodynamics
=================================================

These notes are collected from a number of sources, including my own notes from when I was an undergraduate,
notes I made when I was a post-graduate, and more recently, notes I've written for lectures I have given.

Hopefully they're of some use to someone.

.. warning::

   It's very likely that there are mistakes in these notes.
   Many of them were taken at some speed, so please be cautious while using them.
   I'm working to revise them, but this is slow work, and taken-on mostly in spare time.
