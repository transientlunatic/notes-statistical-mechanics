# Notes on Statistical Mechanics

These are my notes on Statistical Mechanics and thermodynamics. They
are mostly derived from the notes which I took during an undergraduate
course at the University of Glasgow, taught by Dr Declan Diver, but
they've been added to here and there with other bits and pieces of
information.

You're welcome to use these notes, but they may contain errors, so
proceed with caution, and note that here (may) be dragons. If you do
find an error, however, I'd be happy to receive bug reports,
suggestions, and the like through Github (the repository storing these
notes can be found at
https://github.com/transientlunatic/notes-statistical-mechanics). 

Right now you're welcome to use these notes under the terms of the
CC-NC-ND 4.0 license.
